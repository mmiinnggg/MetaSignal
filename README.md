- This code corresponds to the article _'MetaSignal: Meta Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control via Fourier Basis Approximation'_, which has been submitted to _IEEE T-ITS_ and is currently under review..

- For the algo data and many other information, we are grateful for the project [_Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control_](https://traffic-signal-control.github.io/).

- The code may subsequently be upgraded along with changes to the manuscript, thank you for your interest!
